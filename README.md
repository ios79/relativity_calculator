# 🚀 Relativity Calculator

**Experience Einstein’s Theory in Action! ⚡**  
This is a Flask-based web application that calculates **time dilation, length contraction, and relativistic kinetic energy** based on Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity.  

It also includes a **graph visualization** demonstrating why objects cannot reach the speed of light.

## 📌 Features
✔️ **Time Dilation** – See how time slows down at high velocities.  
✔️ **Length Contraction** – Observe how objects shrink when moving fast.  
✔️ **Relativistic Kinetic Energy** – Calculate energy at near-light speeds.  
✔️ **Mass vs. Velocity Graph** – Understand why reaching light speed is impossible.  
✔️ **User-Friendly UI** – Simple, intuitive web interface.
